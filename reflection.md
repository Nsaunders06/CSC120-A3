Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
   I worked/consulted with Sofia, Liyana and Miriam. 
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    I attended Ab's office hours on 9/19 and TA hours on 9/24. 
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I like Java a lot more than python. It is a little harder to work with and get oriented, however, not having to use white space is a lot easier for me. I also like how it is all object oriented over having the choice which for this course makes it easier to use.  
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
From looking at the two languages I can see some similarities between the two languages. They both rely on a sequential organization and have a set procedure. They also both start with declaring variables and transporting informaition and then have some main function that makes evreything work. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
This assignment was difficult for me. I would highly recomond for someone else taking this course to write out all of the tasks and then orgnaize your code before you write it. I also would highly recomond using levels in the rubric as they helped to guide me a lot. Lastly, I would make sure to utalize all your resources including TA hours and your peers as they can be a really good resource.
